# Example Server
This is a toy server that illustrates how to use the parquetjs library built with esbuild.
To run it: 
1. `npm install`
1. View and edit the files in `views` to taste   
1. Within `examples/server directory`:  `node app.js`
1. Build and serve the parquetjs bundle in the main parquetjs directory: `npm run serve`    
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to proceed with your testing -- console, UI interaction, and so on.
